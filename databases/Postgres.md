### Composite types

- Create a composite type

    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER
);
```

- person_type can be used as a column type in a table

- Create a typed table

```sql
CREATE TABLE people OF person_type;
# Will contain id, name and age columns
```

### Types of tables

#### Typed tables

#### Temporary tables

- Only exists for the duration of the session
- Use to store intermediate results of complex queries

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE sales_summary AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Unclogged Tables

- Skips the WAL logs
- A table can be defined as clogged or unclogged at any point in its lifecycle
- The table is entirely truncated after a restart because it might be violating the ACID properties
- Since WAL logs are not written, replication is not supported
